# Expense-script
A minimal Python command-line utility designed to solve the real-world headache of splitting group expenses after a trip or shared event. It tracks bills, finds who owes whom, and calculates the necessary transfers to zero out the ledger using a simple, effective settlement method. Data is persisted to a local JSON file.
